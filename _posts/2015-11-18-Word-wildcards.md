What Are Wildcards?
-------------------

The standard Find and Replace functionality in Microsoft Word is limited to finding exact matches of characters (e.g. letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.) Sometimes, it would be nice if you could search by rules. For example, instead of searching for "12345" (which, of course, would only match the exact number "12345") you could instead search for all numbers that are exactly five digits in length, which would match "12345", but also match "67890" (which might be useful if you needed to detect zip codes). The Advanced Find and Replace in Word allows you to search by rules, and these rules are created using wildcards.


Using Wildcards
---------------

To use the Advanced Find and Replace, select Advanced Find and Replace under the Edit menu:

![Advanced Find and Replace menu item]({{ "/img/word-adv-find.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Be sure to check the box next to "Use wildcards":

![Select "Use wildcards"]({{ "/img/word-adv-find-wildcard.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

And if you need reminders about the syntax, click on the "Special" drop-down menu:

!["Special" menu helper]({{ "/img/word-adv-find-special-menu.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
