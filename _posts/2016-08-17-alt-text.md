Providing descriptive alt text can be a great UI improvement when images fail to load or when using a screen reader.

    <img src="cat.gif" alt="Animation of a cat swiping at a shoelace">

Whenever an image is described in HTML, the alt attribute should be present, even if the alt text value itself is empty.

## Alt text length

There isn't a defined character limit on alt text. Due to the way screen readers and some browsers handle long alt text, **keeping alt text under 125 characters in length is recommended**. If an image requires a longer description, consider the techniques mentioned in [going beyond alt text](#going-beyond-alt-text).

## Leaving alt text empty

### Avoiding duplicate content

    <p>
      <img src="cat.gif" alt=""><br>
      Animation of a cat swiping at a shoelace
    </p>

In the example above, the text that would be used as alt text is already being displayed below the image. To avoid having the same text read twice in a screen reader, we leave the alt attribute empty.

### Decorative images

    <img src="fancy-horizontal-rule.png" alt="">

This example places an image containing a horizontal rule on the page. Since this is used for visually separating the page and doesn't convey anything meaningful, we leave the alt attribute empty.

## Going beyond alt text

When an image requires a longer, more detailed description, we often move the alt text out of the image tag and link to a HTML description.

If the longer description immediately follows the image, the alt attribute can be left blank. If the longer description is further away from the image, you can mention the presence of a more detailed description ```<img src="chart.png" alt="Text description provided below">```.

## Alt text tips

### Spell out acroymns

Alt text with acronyms should be written with spaces in between letters.

```<img src="logo.png" alt="ITS at ONC">``` reads as "It's at onc".

```<img src="logo.png" alt="I T S at O N C" >``` reads as "ITS at ONC".

### Style alt text for proper contrast ratio

Styling alt text is important when there is a chance that images will not load. This is often the case with HTML email, where email clients will not download images unless a user tells them to.

A page with a dark background and a missing image could look like this:

![Unstyled alt text]({{ "/img/alt-text-styling-1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Adding some CSS to the image itself will provide better contrast for the alt text when the image doesn't show:

![Styled alt text]({{ "/img/alt-text-styling-2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
