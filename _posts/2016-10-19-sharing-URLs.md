> ## What link should I send?

When they are available we should send pre-prod links.

Examples:

  * <https://dev.healthfinder.gov/>
  * <https://dev.health.gov/>
  * <http://hp-pre-prod.communicatehealth.com/> *
  
    <pre><code>*NOTE: [subdomain].communicatehealth.com URLs often don't work in the Noho
    office because of the domain controller issues. You can use this URL instead:
    http://158.74.52.198/, but you should send the friendly URL to clients.</code>
    </pre>

> ## Any exceptions?

Oh yeah, plenty!

When the site is built with Jekyll it often generates a github-pages URL. That's a good one to share.

Examples:

  * <https://communicatehealth.github.io/onc-playbook/>
  * <https://communicatehealth.github.io/hp-hd-widget/>
  * <https://comhealth-odphp.github.io/emarketing/Health.gov/2016/08-03-16-PAG.html> (ODPHP emails)
  * <https://communicatehealth.github.io/DeveloperTips/> (this one!)

> ## What about clients that don't have a pre-prod server and aren't on Github pages?

Then we send the dev link :cry:
