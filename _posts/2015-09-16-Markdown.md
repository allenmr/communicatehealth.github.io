What is Markdown?
-----------------

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling writing on the web.

Why Should I Care?
------------------

You've all used WYSYWIG editors like this one on Healthy People:

![WYSIWYG]({{ "/img/wysiwyg.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

In the past, a WYSIWYG editing tools gave away too much design control. Someone could unknowingly add a new style to the design (like red italic bold headers) without meaning to. More often than not, it was a purposeful design addition, but that inevitably leads to a race to the bottom, so style treatment became larger, bolder, and brighter. This makes designers (and developers) sad :( because their carefully crafted theme gets lost in the noise.

Why is Markdown better?
-----------------------

With Markdown you use some really simple syntax to turn your text into semantic HTML code (that will display correctly using the expected CSS)
