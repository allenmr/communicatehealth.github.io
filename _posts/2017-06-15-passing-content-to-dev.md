You've just written the most beautiful content and it's ready to go to the developer! Here are some recommendations and guidelines to help shepherd your content through the development stage.

## What the developer sees in your content deliverable
<img class="f-left" src="{{ "/img/content-to-a-dev.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">
<div class="clearfix">Blocks denoting headers, paragraphs, lists - no actual text!</div>

### Stuff we don't see
* Small changes &mdash; a letter, punctuation, sometimes whole words.
**If an edit doesn't change the length of the line, odds are good we are going to miss it!**

### Stuff we ignore
* Page headers and footers
* Most comments (use the developer's name to call out a particular comment &mdash; <mark>highlight the dev's name</mark>, if you really want to be sure)

## Why good formatting matters
We often use tools like [Wordup](https://communicatehealth.github.io/wordup/) or the WYSIWYG editor in a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (Drupal, healthfinder admin) to convert Word Docs to HTML &mdash; but these tools are only as smart as the content that goes into them. If your content isn't correctly laid out then the tool may delete or reformat in unexpected ways! The best way to keep your content intact is to make sure your document is well formatted from the start:
* Use headers in the correct order (H1 > H2 > H3, etc)
* Format spacing using styles (don't use empty paragraphs between content)
* Accept all changes and turn of tracking unless these changes are specifically for the developer (see below for more details)
* Delete comments that are not specifically for the developer
  * Embed any links directly into the content - links in comments are easy to miss!

## When to use track changes
* Changes are to content that the developer has already coded (content is already on the website/prototype). These are final changes &mdash; all comments or suggestions are resolved.
