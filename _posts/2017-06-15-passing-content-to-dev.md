You've just written the most beautiful content and it's ready to go to the developer! Here are some recommendations and guidelines to help shepherd your content through the development stage.

## What the developer sees in your content deliverable
<img class="f-right" src="{{ "/img/content-to-a-dev.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="colored blocks denoting headers, paragraphs, lists - no actual text">
### Stuff we ignore
* Page headers and footers
* Most comments (use the developer's name to call out a particular comment - highlight it as well, if you really want to be sure)

### Stuff we don't see
* Small changes - a letter, punctuation, sometimes whole words.

**If it doesn't change the length of the line, odds are good we are going to miss it**

## Why good formatting matters
We often use [Wordup](https://communicatehealth.github.io/wordup/) to convert Word Docs to HTML, but sometimes it strips things out. The best way to ensure this doesn't happen is to make sure your document is well formatted from the start:
* Use headers in the correct order (H1 > H2 > H3, etc)
* Paragraphs use style spacing (not empty paragraphs between content)
* Accept all changes and turn of tracking unless these changes are specifically for the developer (see below for more details)
* Delete comments that are not specifically for the developer

## When to use track changes
* Changes to content the developer has already coded (already on the website/prototype)
* Final changes - all comments or suggestions are resolved
