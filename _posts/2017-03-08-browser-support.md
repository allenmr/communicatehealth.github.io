Use this post as a reference when setting up your [QC checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VBdQEB1AHVX1WyGQzuE8-AWTzZfVcKkC9vSniK4gzWY/edit#gid=0). This post was last updated on **04/29/2019**.<!--Update whenever browser list is updates --> The most accurate list of supported browsers is [the CH specification of &gt; .5% in US and last 2 versions](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+.5%25+in+US+and+last+2+versions).

QC the website in BrowserStack on the following operating systems and browsers (unless otherwise indicated by Dev).

## Browsers
This is the default list that we support &mdash; when you kick off a project give your client this list. You can let them know we can add older browsers, but try to discourage it unless there is a really good reason.
  * Latest official/stable release for:
    * Chrome
    * Safari
    * Firefox
    * Edge
    * IE

**Notes:**
  * If we have analytics for a site, we may add or drop browsers depending on usage.

## Operating Systems
  * Windows - [Mainstream support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet):
    * 10
  * OSX - [Apple supports editions "n", "n-1" and "n-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS#Release_history)
    * Mojave
    * High Sierra
  * Mobile, latest versions (phone) (tablet as needed)
    * Note: some devices have more than one browser option. Check all browsers.
    * iOS
    * Android
