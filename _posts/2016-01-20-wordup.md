Copying from a Word document into a CMS (Drupal, Wordpress, other)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Copying from Word directly into a webpage can bring along some messy code that can cause strange font sizes, spacing, and colors among other issues.

Introducing Wordup
------------------

[**Wordup**](http://communicatehealth.github.io/wordup/)

Copy directly from your Word doc into the panel on the left

Clean HTML will be exported on the right side.

Paste into the source section of the CMS of your choice
