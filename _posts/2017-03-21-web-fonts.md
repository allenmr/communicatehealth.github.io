The development team has been researching and troubleshooting our web font usage across all of our projects to come up with some best practices.

We've encountered issues with web fonts on ODPHP and CDC sites recently. CDC does not allow web fonts to be hosted by third-parties (TypeKit, Google Fonts). Internally, ODPHP is blocking web fonts completely in Internet Explorer, regardless of where they are hosted.

To address these constraints, we're proposing two solutions:

1. Self-host all web fonts
2. Provide specific fallback font stacks in CSS, using system fonts

## Self-hosting Web Fonts

The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) recommends self-hosting web fonts. CDC prohibits referencing third-party hosting of web fonts. The security restrictions we often face with government sites makes self-hosting the most reliable solution to get the intended web fonts to users.

The drawback of this approach is that the font (or font service) licensing needs to allow for self-hosting. This means:

- TypeKit can't be used for production sites - they don't allow self-hosting
- Google Fonts is the primary font library to use - self-hosting is allowed

One of the extra complications of TypeKit is that "kits" are tied to an individual's Adobe account. This can make maintenance difficult if there are staffing changes.

## Provide specific fallback font stacks

In the case of users on the ODPHP network, web fonts are being blocked regardless of where they are hosted. Additionally, users who have installed content blockers on their devices can also choose to disable the loading of web fonts for performance and privacy reasons.

This is what the Dietary Guidelines site looks like to ODPHP staff using IE:
![DGA in IE]({{ "/img/dga-screenshot.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})


When using web fonts, we should also provide fallback font options that are:

- Generally available as system fonts on most operating systems
- Reasonable close in style to the intended web font
- Closely match dimensions (x-height, etc.) of intended web font to avoid layout inconsistency

As mentioned in the Email Templates post, some example fallback font stacks:

Generating a custom font stack could look like:
```
font-family: Ideal, Alternative, Common, Generic;
```

Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif stack:
```
font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;
```

Cambria, Georgia, serif stack:
```
font-family: Cambria, Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif;
```

A system default stack that includes Apple's San Francisco font:
```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

## What if we really need a specific typeface?

Futura and Proxima Nova are two typefaces we use regularly. Neither one is available on Google Fonts. We could look into using another service that includes more typefaces, with the ability to self-host. [Fonts.com (MonoType)](https://www.fonts.com/web-fonts#webplans) allows self-hosting on some of their plans.
