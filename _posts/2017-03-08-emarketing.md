A brief explanation for all those questions we ask you once you hand a bulletin off to dev.

## Types of Email 

### ODPHP
We send out 2 types of ODPHP emails using GovDelivery:

These emails are hand crafted as needed and sent to specific mailing lists.

Users can sign up through ODPHP's [QuickSubscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USOPHSODPHPHF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USOPHSODPHPHF_1) links found throughout the 3 OHPHP sites. Anyone who is subscribed will get these emails.

## Life cycle of an existing bulletin (from a dev's perspective)

## New email templates
New email templates aren't created very often, but if you need one, the following guidelines will help smooth the process:
  * Start with Design to get a mockup and assets ([example](https://communicatehealth.app.box.com/files/0/f/13442234877/1/f_116110164663))
    * If possible, provide actual content &mdash; it's harder to predict issues in lorem ipsum
  * If this is a new template for an existing topic: turn off pagewatch autosend. We don't want to spam our users while we test changes!
  * Email clients really *really* don't always show the same thing. If the client says layout looks off, be prepared to troubleshoot &mdash; ask for screenshots and get their email client and OS

## Tips to make your email coder happy:
  * Include all known URLs 
    * Existing pages: even if you are waiting for drafts to be published before sending the bulletin, the URL won't change
    * New pages: if you know what the URL will be, we can include it
  * Include the bill code in the task description or as a TW tag
  * Keep it all in one TW task: we like to know where a bulletin is in the coding process
